# Media Playback Speed

### Requirements
- PHP 5.3+ for closures
- jQuery (enqueued by the plugin)

This short handy plugin will add playback buttons to your audio and video elements added via the built-in wordpress shortcodes for media using mediaelement.js. Each set of buttons is configured for it's corresponding element on the page, so you can adjust the speed of multiple files independantly. 

There is currently no persistence implemented in this plugin. It just scratches an itch to be able to broadly adjust media playback speeds using the HTML api.

**NOTE:** This uses the HTML5 media Element API. Any browser not supporting these or using the Flash Player fallback will miss out on this functionality.

Tested up to WordPress 4.9.1
